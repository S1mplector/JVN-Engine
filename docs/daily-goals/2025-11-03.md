# Daily Goals — 2025-11-03

## High Priority
- [ ] Integrate Save/Export in EditorApp (File → Save / Save As) using `JesExporter`.
- [ ] Expose a read-only snapshot of named entities from `JesScene2D` for exporter (e.g., `getNamed()` or `exportNamed()` returning Map<String,Entity2D>).
- [ ] Build and verify editor end-to-end with `samples/billiards.jes` and `samples/showcase.jes`.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Add camera pan/zoom controls in EditorApp (attach `Camera2D`; mouse wheel = zoom, right/middle drag = pan).
- [ ] Inspector: extend `PhysicsBody2D` with `static`, `sensor`, `vx`, `vy` fields.
- [ ] Inspector: add full `ParticleEmitter2D` controls (emissionRate, life/size/speed/angles, gravity, start/end colors, texture, additive).

## Low Priority
- [ ] Improve `Label2D` picking with measured text bounds (use `TextMetrics` or JavaFX Text layout).
- [ ] Support scene-level props in JES (e.g., `gravityX`, `gravityY`, `bounds`) and apply in `JesLoader` to `JesScene2D.world`.
- [ ] Editor: scroll-to-selection in Scene Graph; quick filter by name.
- [ ] Documentation polish for new features (Editor Save/Export, camera, inspectors).

## Stretch
- [ ] Undo/redo foundation (command stack) for inspector edits.
- [ ] Camera "fit to content" button and reset view.
- [ ] Export round-trip test (export → reload → diff AST).

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Open → Edit → Save → Reload round-trip works for all components.
- [ ] Scene Graph selection + canvas picking consistent for all types.
- [ ] Timeline easing visible in showcase and unaffected by camera transforms.

## Useful Commands
- Run editor: `./gradlew :editor:run`
- Run editor (skip unrelated tests): `./gradlew :editor:run -x test`
- Runtime (Swing UI): `./gradlew :runtime:run --args="--jes samples/billiards.jes --ui swing"`
